//let [firstBook, secondbook] = books;

console.log(firstBook, secondBook);

//Destructure the books array into a variable called thirdBook. You must skip the first two books.

//1.3
// Below is the nested ratings array that contains two other arrays. Destructure the nested ratings arrays into two variables called rating and ratingsCount. In the result of your destructuring, the ratings variable should store a number 4.19, and the ratingsCount variable should store a number 144584.

  ["rating", 4.19],
  ["ratingsCount", 144584],
];

const [fiveStarRatings, oneStarRatings, threeStarRatings = 0] = ratingStars;

console.log(fiveStarRatings, oneStarRatings, threeStarRatings);

// 2.Destructuring Objects

// 2.1
// Destructure the first book object from the books array into variables called title, author and ISBN.

const { title, author, ISBN } = books[0];
console.log(title, author, ISBN);
// 2.2
// Each book object has the keywords property. Destructure the first book object from the books array into a variable called tags. The tags variable should be assigned with the value of the keywords property.

const { keywords: tags } = books[0];
console.log(tags);

// 2.3
// The seventh book from the books array is missing the programmingLanguage property. Destructure the seventh book object (books[6]) into variables called language and programmingLanguage. Assign the programmingLanguage variable with a default value of 'unknown'.

// 3.) Spread Operator

// 3.1
// Each book object has the author property, which stores an array of strings (author names) if there are multiple authors, or a single string (author name) if there is just one author.

// Declare an array called bookAuthors, and fill it with authors of the first two books from the books array. The bookAuthors array should have just one level (no nested arrays).

const bookAuthors = [...books[0].author, ...books[1].author];

// 4.)Rest Operator and Spread Operator

//4.1

//Destructure the second book from the books array into a variable called bookPublisher. The bookPublisher variable should be assigned with the value of the publisher property of the book object. Assign the rest of the properties to the restOfTheBook variable.

const { publisher: bookPublisher, ...restOfTheBook } = books[1];
console.log(bookPublisher, restOfTheBook);

//4.3
//Write a function called printBookAuthorsCount that has two parameters called title and authors. The authors parameter should accept any number of arguments. This function should log to the console a string formatted like that: "The book "${title}" has ${authors.length} authors".

// 5.)Short Circuiting (&& and ||)

//5.1
//Some of the book objects have the programmingLanguage property, which specifies what programming language is used in the book, for example

let hasExamplesInJava = function (language) {
  return language == "java" || "no data";
};
const ans = hasExamplesInJava(books[2].programmingLanguage);

//5.2
//Some of the book objects have the onlineContent property, which is either true or false. Loop over the books array, and for the books that provide online content, log to the console a string in this format: "${title}" provides online content. Use short-circuiting.

for (let i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
  books[i].onlineContent &&
    console.log(`"${books[i].title}" provides online content`);
}

// 6.)The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

//6.1
//There are objects in the books array that don't have the onlineContent property at all. Loop over the books array, and log a string to the console in this format: "${title}" provides no data about its online content.

for (let i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
  books[i].onlineContent ??
    console.log(
      `"${books[i].title}" provides no data about its online content`
    );
}

// 7.)Logical Assignments Operators
//7.1
//Some of the book objects from the books array are missing the edition property. Loop over the books array, and assign this property with a number 1 (if it doesn't already exist). Use logical assignment operators.

for (let i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
  books[i].edition ??= 1;
}
console.log(books[books.length - 2].edition);

//7.2
//Some of the book objects from the books array have the highlighted property, which by default is set to true. Iterate over the books array, and if the thirdParty.goodreads.rating property is less than 4.2, reassign it with false.
//Use the &&= operator (tip: you may also need the ! operator)

for (let i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
  books[i].highlighted = books[i].thirdParty.goodreads.rating < 4.2 && "false";
}

// 8) Looping Arrays: The for-of Loop

//8.1
//Use the for-of loop to loop over the books array and sum the pages of all books. Use the pageSum variable below, and the pages property of the book objects.
let pageSum = 0;
for (let book of books) {
  pageSum += book.pages;
}
console.log(pageSum);

//8.2
//Below is the allAuthors variable which stores an empty array. Use the for-of loop to fill allAuthors with the authors of each book from the books array.
//Remember that each book object has the author property, which can be a string (if there is only a single author) or an array (if there are multiple authors). You may need to use the typeof operator. You can also use multiple loops if needed. The allAuthors array should have just one level (no nested arrays).

const allAuthors = [];

for (let book of books) {
  if (typeof book.author === "object") {
    for (let name of book.author) allAuthors[allAuthors.length] = name;
  } else allAuthors[allAuthors.length] = book.author;
}

console.log(allAuthors);

//8.3
//Use the for-of loop together with Array's entries() method to log each author from allAuthors to the console together with its index. Make the index start from 1, instead of 0.

for (let [index, author] of allAuthors.entries()) {
  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${author}`);
}
